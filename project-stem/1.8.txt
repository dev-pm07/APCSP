What type of data are time, date, and place? How are they different from the other data types on the invite and guest list?
The type of time is string because to include the AM and PM, we need a string unless you split the time into 2 variables (int for time and boolean for AM and PM). 
We can split up the date variable into 3 separate variables: month, date, year. They are different because one consists of many alphanumeric characters and one just consists or numeric characters.
Place is a combination of an int (Street Number), string (Street name), string (City name), string (State name), int (Zip Code)

What components are included within "Address"? What are the types and differences to them?
The address is a combination of an int (Street Number), string (Street name), string (City name), string (State name), int (Zip Code). Strings can  consist of letters and integers

How might your invitation be a framework for other events? How can events be tailored? What could be a variable, in the traditional definition of the word?
It is a framework since it consists of all variables needed to host an event. It can be tailored by changing the variables such as the time and address variables. 
Where and when it is, RSVP, theme, invitee names and emails, and contact information are all examples of variables since it can changed to suit the user's needs.
