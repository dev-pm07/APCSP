Brainstorming:

    Idea 1:
        - Spiral from center
        - Fan design across screen (loops)
        - Each space between blade is different color
        - If statements for checking if the turtle is touching wall.

    *** Idea 2:
        - Sea Stars waving in the sea.
        - multiple barnacles (Loop) (check if they are near each other)
    
Requirements:

    Basic functionality:

    Create a variety of shapes to produce a unique, artistic artifact - Shapes including the star, many rows of circles for barnacles patches
    Use color and size variations to enhance your artwork - Red for starfish, white and brown for barnacles, blue for sea. Sizes of barnacles and starfish are different.
    Use movement to enhance your artifact - The starfish will move with the movement of the water, barnacles releasing bubbles and moving up.
    Use iteration (looping) and conditional execution (if statements) to control the drawing - multiple barnacles patches (Loop to create multiple) 
    (conditional: check if they are near each other)

    To help you in creating your artwork:

    Use existing turtle methods.
    Choose descriptive variable names.
    Comment code segments or blocks of statements.

Decomposition:

    Part 1 - Ocean:
        - Background color as light blue 
    
    Part 2 - Starfish:
        - Using lines and fill, draw starfish

    Part 3 - Barnacles:
        - Check distance between edge and screen
        - Loop circles, maybe 50
    
    Part 4a - Bubble of Barnacles:
        - Loop tiny circles coming up from barnacle
        - Loop it going up til it goes out of screen

    Part 4b - Movement of Starfish:
        - Split arms of starfish and move them - not feasable

Milestones

    1.) Ocean and starfish

    2.) Create barnacles

    3.) Animation of Barnacles.

Pseudocode:

    set background color to ocean blue
    go to (-50, -50)
    set pen color to red
    fill color is crimson
    begin fill
    head is 0
    for i in 5
        set heading to head + 36
        move forward 50 steps
    end fill
    create barnacles
    create barnacle bubbles


Redisgned features - None.

Testing - All milestones reached.
